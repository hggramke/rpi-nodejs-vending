# **Raspberry Pi Vending Machine**

## **Overview**

This project is a simple vending machine script created for a high school class in 2024\. The goal was to develop a beautiful and attractive web interface that interacts with the GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi computer. The interface can be controlled from various devices, such as an old iPad in kiosk mode, or any device connected to the same Wi-Fi network through the ip address.

## **Features**

* **Web Interface:** Controlled by a display connected to the Raspberry Pi or an external device on the same network.  
* **Node.js Server:** Handles on/off commands sent by the client (browser window).  
* **Status LED:** Independent of the browser to avoid issues like server failure.  
* **Customizable Interface:** Allows for potential integration with USB credit card readers.
